# workstation

Scripts for unattended setup of my Linux workstation.

## Prerequisites

I use 3 main partitions: 2 small ones for side-by-side os installs and one bigger for my profile and work stuff — mounted in non standard `/data` folder.

I wat to be able to switch OSes quicly without loosing my work files AND selected profile settings that can be shared between OSes. 


## Setup

These scripts help me geting a new OS install ready for work quickly:

	sudo apt-get install -y git && git clone https://github.com/wooyek/workstation.git && cd workstation && sudo bash setup.sh
    
I currently use and tested these with KDE LinuxMint.

## TODO

These require manual settings (help getting them scripted is appreciated):

1. Setup terminal to use nerd fonts
2. Setup dracula color schem
3. Setup Papirus iconset
