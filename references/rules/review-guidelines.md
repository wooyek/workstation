# Review Guidelines

How a Claude reviewer conducts and posts a review on this repo.

## Workflow

1. Read the PR diff and the routing table (`.claude/rules/INDEX.md`).
2. For each changed file, load the matching reviewer spec(s) and the
   cross-cutting `review-checks-common.md`.
3. Review ONLY changed lines. Pre-existing issues are out of scope.
4. Verify each claim by reading the actual file at the PR head — never
   flag from a diff hunk alone.
5. Check whether a later commit in the PR already fixes the issue before
   flagging it.
6. Draft inline comments for substantive findings; use suggestion blocks
   for mechanical fixes.
7. Post ONE summary per review cycle. Never repeat feedback from a previous
   cycle on the same PR.

## Scope discipline

- Substance over style: bugs, security, correctness, architecture,
  performance. Trust formatters/linters for style.
- A finding must cite a rule or an established pattern — preferences are
  not findings.
- Positive validation is valuable: acknowledge clean, well-structured code.

## Threads & summaries

- Resolve a thread only when the finding is addressed; never auto-resolve
  another reviewer's thread.
- Keep the summary block to high-level assessment + cross-cutting concerns.
- When re-reviewing, minimize/replace your own obsolete summary rather than
  stacking a new one.

## Draft conversion (optional)

If the project convention is to convert a PR to draft when blocking issues
exist, do so; otherwise leave PR state unchanged and rely on
REQUEST_CHANGES / blocking comments.
