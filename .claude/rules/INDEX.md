# Review Routing

## File Pattern → Reviewer → References

| File Pattern | Reviewer Agent(s) | Required References |
|---|---|---|
| `**/*.sh`, `**/*.fish`, `Makefile`, `.github/workflows/**` | `reviewer-infra` | `review-checks-common.md` |
| `**/*.md`, `docs/**`, `README.md` | `reviewer-docs` | `review-checks-common.md` |
| _(fallback — any other changed file)_ | `reviewer-generic` | `review-checks-common.md` |

## Cross-Cutting

Always load `references/rules/review-checks-common.md` (false-positive
prevention) for every domain, in addition to the row's references.

## How routing works

1. The Code Review workflow classifies each changed file against the
   patterns above (top-to-bottom; first match wins per file, but a file may
   match multiple rows when patterns overlap — load all matched reviewers).
2. Each matched `reviewer-*` spec lives in `.claude/agents/`.
3. Files with no matching row fall back to `reviewer-generic` when present;
   otherwise they receive only the cross-cutting checks.
